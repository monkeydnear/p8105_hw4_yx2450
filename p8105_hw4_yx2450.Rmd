In Problems 1 and 2, I worked with Manqi Cai (UNI: mc4433).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
```

### Problem 1
```{r}
pups_data = read_csv("../data/data_import_examples/FAS_pups.csv", col_types = "ciiiii") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female")) %>% 
  mutate(PD_outcome = pd_ears + pd_eyes + pd_pivot + pd_walk) %>% 
  drop_na()

pups_tidy_data = gather(pups_data, key = pd, value = days, pd_ears: PD_outcome)
```
